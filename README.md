# C-Autoreleasepool
## Description
An attempt to implement NSAutoreleasepool (or @autoreleasepool{...}) from Objective-C and Cocoa purely in C into the C language.
I thought this would be useful for someone and implemented this within a weekend or so.
I did not find any compareable project yet but if you have one which is better, tell me and we can merge together! Email me if you find this useful and think i continue to work on this.
For the full documentation look here: **http://h6nry.github.io/c-autoreleasepool.html**

## Short docs
Import C-Autoreleasepool.c and C-Autoreleasepool.h into your project.
Use *gc_autoreleasepool( your_code_here )* for an autoreleasepool.
Malloc-Test.c is a testing file for you to test capabilities.

## License
Do what you want with it, just email me if you are going to publish parts of this.
I also would like to be mentioned in the source code, if published in source code form,
and credited, if published only in binary form.
Due to the informality of this license, you are allowed to ignore this if you really want to.
